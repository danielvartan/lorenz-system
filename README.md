This repository contains an illustration of the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system), originally introduced by Edward N. Lorenz in his seminal [1963](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/20/2/1520-0469_1963_020_0130_dnf_2_0_co_2.xml) paper. The Lorenz system comprises three coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations that model atmospheric convection, effectively illustrating the chaotic nature of weather patterns.

The report is available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/lorenz-system/).
